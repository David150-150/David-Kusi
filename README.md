Project Overview

This project involved creating a simple Greeting Cards application using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. The goal was to build a responsive app that displays greeting cards with customizable titles and messages. By working on this project, I aimed to learn how to build React components, pass props between them, and use Tailwind CSS for styling.
What I Learned

From this project, I learned how to set up a React app with Vite for faster development. I also learned how to use Tailwind CSS to quickly style the app and make it responsive. Working with React components and props helped me understand how to pass data between components, making the app dynamic and flexible.
Application Features

The Greeting Cards app includes:

    A Header component that displays a welcome message.
    Multiple GreetingCard components that accept title and message as props to display different cards.
    A responsive design that works well on both mobile and desktop devices using Tailwind CSS.

Reflection

This project helped me improve my skills in React and styling with Tailwind CSS. I got hands-on experience with functional components and props, and I learned how to create a simple, reusable layout. It was a great way to strengthen my understanding of React and how to structure a basic web application.
Challenges

One of the challenges I faced during the project was getting Tailwind CSS to work properly. I had some issues with setting it up correctly in the React environment, which initially caused the styles not to apply as expected. After some troubleshooting and reviewing the setup steps, I was able to resolve these issues. The most significant problem was ensuring that the responsive design worked well across different screen sizes. Although Tailwind CSS is designed for this, I needed to make sure the layout adjusted correctly without breaking, especially on smaller screens.
